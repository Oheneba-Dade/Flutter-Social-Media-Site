A page or section will be provided which shows all the posts made by users in descending order of time. The page will update in real-time to show new posts.

## Functionality 6: Email Notification

All frontend development will be done using Flutter, and all code will be deployed in the cloud. The backend will use appropriate REST APIs to interact with the database.
